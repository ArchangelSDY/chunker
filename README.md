Chunker - Easy Chunk-Based File Structure Parsing
=======
Chunker provides simple APIs to help parsing chunk-based file structure such as Zip/PNG/JPEG/WAV, etc.

You simply define the structure and Chunker handles the rest.

For more information, see docs [here](http://archangelsdy.github.io/chunker/index.html)

Installation

You can install Chunker with pip:

```
$ pip install chunker
```
