Chunker - Easy Chunk-Based File Structure Parsing
=======
Chunker provides simple APIs to help parsing chunk-based file structure such as Zip/PNG/JPEG/WAV, etc.

You simply define the structure and Chunker handles the rest.

For more information, see docs [here](http://archangelsdy.github.io/chunker/index.html)

Installation
------------
You can install Chunker with pip:

```
$ pip install chunker
```

Todos
-----
Here are some parts that are not complete or I'm not very satisfied with:

* More pre-defined field types.
* Improve Chunk.matches. It's still a bit complicated at present.

Feel free to send me pull requests if you have any other idea to improve Chunker.
